**MaxEnt - Maximum Entropy Code** is an easy to run Matlab code for calculation of the maximum entropy distributions and the corresponding statistical samples from a given set of known information. The implementation is numerically robust and follows an educational style, to make its use very intuitive. Examples with a few, but representatiove, benckmark tests are provided to illustrate the code functionality.

## Documentation
