**MaxEnt - Maximum Entropy Code** is an easy to run Matlab code for calculation of the maximum entropy distributions and the corresponding statistical samples from a given set of known information. The implementation is numerically robust and follows an educational style, to make its use very intuitive. Examples with representative benchmark tests are provided.

## Documentation

**MaxEnt** routines are commented to explain their functionality to the final user. Each routine has a short description of its purpose and a list of inputs and/or outputs. Examples with a few, but representative, benchmark tests are provided to illustrate the code functionality.
